# Niche_Tech_Guides
These are guides to show you how to do stuff I needed help learning, so I basically compiled it under this directory. 
Topics can range from:
* Linux Related
* GIMP Related
* Blender Related
* Godot

Sources will be listed at the bottom of pages as needed.

Current Guides:
* Linux Cookbook 1.1 (Fedora, Debian, Unbuntu)
